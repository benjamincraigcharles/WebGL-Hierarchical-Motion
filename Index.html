    <meta name="description" content="Hierarchical Motion can be observed on the bicycle as well as the windmill and
cloud drawn to the canvas. The bicycle exhibits hierarchical motion as follows: the bicycle is propelled forward
due to the rotation of its wheels, which are in turn moving due to the rotation of the bicycle's pedals. The cloud and
windmill exhibit hierarchical motion due to the wind blowing from the left of the canvas to the right, spinning the
windmill and pushing the cloud across the canvas.">
